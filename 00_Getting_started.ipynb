    "- combines text, figures and and other content (similar to a web page)\n",
    "- with executable programming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "That executable programming code can do things like running calculations, doing some operations, generating plots and graphics etc. The programming code is processed by a higher order programming language like ___Python___ or ___R___ (Jupyter stands for _Julia_, _Python_, and _R_ - all common programming languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is processes by an interpreter that transfers the instructions into action. That interpreter is accessed through a web browser and can be placed on the local computer or somewhere in the web. In consequence, using Jupyter Notebooks just needs an web browser. Therefore, Jupyter notebooks are more or less plattform independent (in other words: you dont need to install anything on your computer and you can run the notebooks through your mobile phone too - although this is maybe somewhat limited by the screen size)."
