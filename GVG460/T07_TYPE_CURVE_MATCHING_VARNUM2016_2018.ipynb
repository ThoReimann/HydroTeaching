    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### General situation\n",
    "We consider a confined aquifer with constant transmissivity. If a well is pumping water out of the aquifer, radial flow towards the well is induced. The hydraulics are described by the following simplified flow equation. This equation accounts for 1D radial transient flow towards a fully penetrating well within a confined aquifer without further sinks and sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial r^2}+\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r}=\\frac{S}{T}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution by Theis\n",
    "Charles V. Theis presented a solution for this by deriving\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s(r,t)=\\frac{Q}{4\\pi T}W(u) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the well function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W(u) = \\int_{u }^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\tilde u}}{\\tilde u}d\\tilde u $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the dimensionless variable \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u = \\frac{Sr^2}{4Tt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equations are not easy to solve. Historically, values for the well function were provided by tables or as so called type-curve. The type-curve matching with experimental data for pumping test analysis can be considered as one of the basic hydrogeological methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, modern computer provide an easier and more convinient way to solve the 1D radial flow equation based on the Theis approach."
